This is the nucleus of a deck-building game based heavily on Megacrit's Slay the Spire (go buy it- it's great and they deserve the support). The purpose of the project is to make something as mod-friendly and flexible as possible using modern JavaScript methodologies. I'm a weirdo, so that means using FlowTyped, Inferno, custom state management, etc.
