This is the nucleus of a deck-building game based heavily on Megacrit's Slay the Spire (go buy it; it's great and they deserve the support). The purpose of the project is to make something as mod-friendly and flexible as possible using modern JavaScript methods. I'm a weirdo, so that means using FlowType, Inferno, custom state management, etc. At the heart of the code, there is also a lot of generator shenanigans and some meta classing.
